## Integration Points

### GameManager Integration
- All interactables report to GameManager for central game state tracking
- Room progression and completion events flow through GameManager
- Save/load system integrated with game state

### Event System
- Unity Events used throughout for flexible Inspector-based connections
- C# events for code-based subscriptions
- Clear separation between visual feedback and game logic

### Voice Command Support
- DoorGate and LeverSwitchButton support voice commands
- Ready for integration with Quest 3 voice recognition
- Fallback to CommandInterpreter system

### XR Interaction
- LeverSwitchButton fully integrated with XR Interaction Toolkit
- All interactables support both direct interaction and voice commands
- Proper collider and trigger setup for VR interaction

## Next Steps for Unity Editor

### Prefab Creation Required
1. **RoomEntranceExit Prefab**
   - Add Box Collider (set as trigger)
   - Attach RoomEntranceExit script
   - Configure room ID and events

2. **DoorGate Prefab**
   - Add mesh, collider, and animator
   - Attach DoorGate script
   - Configure door type and movement settings

3. **TreasureChest Prefab**
   - Add chest mesh and animator
   - Attach TreasureChest script
   - Configure loot table and effects

4. **LeverSwitchButton Prefab**
   - Add appropriate mesh and moving parts
   - Attach LeverSwitchButton script
   - Add XR Grab Interactable component
   - Configure interaction type and visual settings

### Scene Setup Required
1. Add GameManager to scene (if not present)
2. Add VRIFUIManager with UI canvas
3. Add EmeraldItemSystem manager
4. Configure player tags ("Player")
5. Set up Meta Avatar, Emerald AI, and VRIF components

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test room transitions with hero movement
- [ ] Verify door interactions (locked/unlocked states)
- [ ] Test treasure chest loot spawning
- [ ] Verify lever/switch/button triggers
- [ ] Test save/load functionality
- [ ] Verify UI updates (health, gold, inventory)
- [ ] Test voice commands (when implemented)
- [ ] Verify enemy defeat â†’ room completion flow

## Code Quality Notes
- All scripts follow Unity best practices
- Proper use of SerializeField for Inspector configuration
- Singleton pattern for managers
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Comprehensive debug logging
- XML documentation for public methods
- Null checks and error handling

## Remaining TODOs in Code
- Voice recognition API integration (Quest 3/Unity)
- Meta Avatar SDK API calls
- Emerald AI death event subscription
- Cloud LLM endpoint connection
- Performance profiling and optimization
