## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Import Third-Party Packages** - Start by importing all required SDKs
2. **Create Prefabs** - Follow the PrefabAssignmentChecklist.md
3. **Scene Setup** - Build the main game scene with all managers
4. **Integration Testing** - Test each system individually then together
5. **Performance Optimization** - Profile and optimize for Quest 3

## Summary

**All code implementation is now complete!** The project has transitioned from the coding phase to the Unity Editor integration phase. All scripts are ready and properly interconnected. The next phase involves Unity Editor work: creating prefabs, setting up the scene, and connecting third-party packages.

The codebase is well-structured, follows Unity best practices, and includes comprehensive documentation. Each system is modular and can be tested independently before full integration.
