# Onboarding Guide - VR Dungeon Game

Welcome to the VR Dungeon Game project! This guide will help you get started as a new team member.

## Project Overview
- A VR/MR dungeon crawler for Quest 3, where players guide a tiny Meta Avatar hero through procedurally generated dungeons using their voice.
- Built with Unity 6000 (2025), Meta Avatar SDK, Emerald AI 2024, VRIF by BNG, XR Interaction Toolkit, and Edgar Pro.

## Folder Structure
- `Assets/Scripts/` — All core, dungeon, hero, combat, communication, and interaction scripts
- `Assets/Prefabs/` — Prefabs for interactables, enemies, hero, UI, etc.
- `Assets/Scenes/` — Unity scenes
- `Assets/Art/`, `Assets/Audio/` — Art and audio assets
- `Assets/Resources/`, `Assets/Plugins/` — Resources and plugins
- `Assets/DesignDocs/` — Design documentation (feature status, interactables, checklists, guides)

## Workflow
1. **Pull latest code and design docs from version control**
2. **Import required Unity packages** (see README)
3. **Open the main scene and assign manager scripts and prefabs**
4. **Test features in Play mode and iterate**
5. **Document changes and update design docs as needed**

## Main Scene Setup
- For a detailed, step-by-step guide to setting up the Main scene (including every GameObject, component, and setting), see **UnityEditorSetupGuide.md** in the DesignDocs folder.
